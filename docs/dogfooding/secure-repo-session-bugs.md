# Secure-Repo Dogfooding — Bug & Improvement Log

**Session date:** 2026-04-30
**Driver:** Claude Code (Opus 4.7) running `/secure-repo@opensec` skill against the OpenSec repo itself.
**Goal:** Drive OpenSec end-to-end on its own repo until clean, log every rough edge.

This file is the running notebook for everything that goes wrong, feels wrong, or could be better — to be triaged into PRs after the session.

## Findings

### 1. CLI has no way to view or change the model
- **Severity:** improvement / posture
- **Where:** `opensec` CLI — no `settings`, `config`, or `model` subcommand
- **What:** To switch model from `gpt-4.1-nano` to `gpt-5-nano`, the only path was hitting `PUT /api/settings/model` with curl. The skill explicitly says "the user fixes config; don't try to fix it from the skill" — but the CLI gives no agent-friendly way to list available models or set one.
- **Why it matters:** Model choice is the #1 thing a user wants to tweak after install (cost, speed, quality). Forcing them into the web UI breaks the "live in your terminal" promise. Agents driving the skill cannot help.
- **Suggested fix:** Add `opensec model get` / `opensec model set <full_id>` / `opensec model list [--provider X]` returning JSON. Surface the same exit-code contract.
- **Status:** fixed in `fix/secure-repo-cli-bugs` — added `opensec model get/set/list` subgroup; `list` projects the catalog locally to `[{id, name}]`.

### 2. PUT `/api/settings/model` field naming is unintuitive
- **Severity:** papercut
- **Where:** `PUT /api/settings/model`
- **What:** Body requires `model_full_id` (e.g. `"openai/gpt-5-nano"`). I first tried `{provider, model_id}` — which is what the GET response *also* returns alongside `model_full_id`. The endpoint validation rejects the structured form even though it round-trips its own response shape.
- **Why it matters:** Echo-back-the-GET is the most natural shape for any client. Right now you have to know to drop two fields and synthesize a slash-joined string.
- **Suggested fix:** Accept either `{model_full_id}` OR `{provider, model_id}` on PUT. Or, better, return a single canonical shape on GET and accept that same shape on PUT.
- **Status:** fixed in `fix/secure-repo-cli-bugs` — `ModelUpdateRequest` now synthesizes `model_full_id` from `{provider, model_id}` when the slash-joined form is missing.

### 3. `/api/settings/api-keys` is misleading when keys come from env vars
- **Severity:** papercut / posture
- **Where:** `GET /api/settings/api-keys`
- **What:** Returns `[]` even when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in the daemon environment and obviously working (scan succeeded). The truth lives in `/api/settings/providers/configured`, where each provider has a `source: "env" | "db"` field.
- **Why it matters:** "Is my key configured?" is the most common pre-scan question. If the dedicated endpoint says "no keys" while the system is happily using one, users will set the key twice or get confused. Same problem in the UI Settings page.
- **Suggested fix:** `/settings/api-keys` should return entries for env-sourced keys too, with `source: "env"` and `key: null` (or `"•••• (env)"`). The frontend can decide how to render it.
- **Status:** fixed in `fix/secure-repo-cli-bugs` — `get_api_keys` merges env-sourced providers (`source: "env"`, `key_masked: null`) and tags DB rows with `source: "db"`. DB wins on dedup.

### 4. `opensec fix` exits 1 on first run with "Sidebar state not found"
- **Severity:** **bug** — blocks the happy path
- **Where:** `cli/opensec_cli/cli.py:268-285` (`fix`) and `cli/opensec_cli/client.py:151-174` (`poll`)
- **What:** `fix` creates the workspace, POSTs `/pipeline/run-all`, then immediately polls `GET /api/workspaces/{id}/sidebar`. The sidebar row is created only when the **first agent writes to it** — so the initial poll races the enricher and 404s. `poll()` treats a 404 as a hard error and re-raises, causing exit 1 with `{"error":"Sidebar state not found"}` and exposing an internal phrase that contradicts the exit-code contract (the user sees "broken" when the pipeline is actually running fine in the background).
- **Why it matters:** This is the very first thing every user does after a scan. On `gpt-5-nano` (slower first response), it fails ~100% of the time on first try. Re-running `opensec fix <id>` works because by then the enricher has written the sidebar.
- **Suggested fix:** In `poll()`, treat HTTP 404 as a transient "not ready yet" — sleep and retry until the deadline. Alternatively, `pipeline/run-all` should synchronously seed an empty `SidebarState` row before returning so the first GET succeeds.
- **Bonus:** Either way, when this *does* time out, the error message should say "pipeline didn't produce a plan within Xs" not "Sidebar state not found" — the latter is an implementation leak.
- **Status:** fixed in `fix/secure-repo-cli-bugs` — `poll()` accepts a `tolerate_status` tuple; `fix` and `approve` pass `(404,)`. Timeouts now surface as JSON with `code: "timeout"` via the `_with_client` wrapper instead of a Python traceback.

### 5. **CRITICAL: CLI ↔ backend plan-schema mismatch — `opensec fix` never detects a completed plan**
- **Severity:** **bug** — full pipeline blocker. This kills the happy path on every issue.
- **Where:** `cli/opensec_cli/cli.py:274-317` (`fix._done` and the rendering of `plan`) vs `backend/opensec/agents/sidebar_mapper.py:118-132` (`_map_planner`)
- **What:** The CLI's `_done` predicate checks `plan.steps` or `plan.summary`. The backend writes `plan.plan_steps`, `plan.interim_mitigation`, `plan.estimated_effort`, `plan.validation_method`, and `definition_of_done.items`. **Neither `plan.steps` nor `plan.summary` is ever written**, so `_done()` always returns False and `poll()` runs to its 900s timeout.
- **Symptom seen this session:** Pipeline finished in ~30s (enricher → exposure → evidence → planner all `completed`). Plan sat in the sidebar for 14+ minutes while the CLI happily polled and saw nothing.
- **Then it gets worse:** `TimeoutError` from `poll()` is **not** caught by the `_with_client` wrapper (`cli.py:46-83` only catches `DaemonDownError`, `VersionMismatchError`, `HTTPError`). The user gets a raw 30-line Python traceback to stderr, breaking the JSON-output contract.
- **The plan-display code is also broken** even if `_done` worked — it reads `plan.summary` (None), `plan.steps` (None), and `plan.definition_of_done` (None, because DoD is a sibling field, not nested under `plan`).
- **Why it matters:** Every single dependency finding hits this. The "agent-shaped, JSON output, exit codes encode state" promise is broken on the very first command the workflow needs.
- **Suggested fix:** Either (a) update CLI to read `plan.plan_steps`, fall back DoD to top-level `definition_of_done.items`; or (b) introduce a stable contract layer in the API: a `GET /api/workspaces/{id}/plan` that returns a CLI-shaped object (`{summary, steps, definition_of_done, status: "ready" | "running" | "approved"}`) decoupled from how the agents structure the sidebar internally.
- **Bonus fixes while there:**
  - Catch `TimeoutError` in `_with_client` and emit a JSON `code: "timeout"` error.
  - The plan display lacks an `summary` field server-side — generate one (e.g. first sentence of the planner's `summary_markdown` from the agent run) and store it under `plan.summary`.
- **Status:** fixed in `fix/secure-repo-cli-bugs` — CLI now reads `plan.plan_steps` and `definition_of_done.items`; emits `{steps, interim_mitigation, definition_of_done, approved}`. Dropped the never-populated `summary` field. Server-side `plan.summary` deferred to a future PR (planner's `summary_markdown` lives on the agent run row, not the sidebar; out of scope here).

### 6. `approve` will read `pull_request.branch` which the backend never writes
- **Severity:** papercut (cosmetic — `pr_url` is read correctly via fallback, so flow continues)
- **Where:** `cli/opensec_cli/cli.py:355` reads `pull_request.get("branch")`. Backend writes `pull_request.branch_name` (`sidebar_mapper.py:151`).
- **Why it matters:** The approve JSON will always show `"branch": null` even when a branch exists.
- **Suggested fix:** Same root cause as #5 — fix CLI field name or add a contract layer.
- **Status:** fixed in `fix/secure-repo-cli-bugs` — `approve` now reads `pull_request.branch_name` (with a `branch` fallback for forward-compat).

### 8. **CRITICAL POSTURE: Trivy / Semgrep walk test-fixture lockfiles, generating ~all findings as false positives**
- **Severity:** **bug** / **posture** — undermines the credibility of every scan run on a repo that ships scanner test data.
- **Where:** `backend/opensec/assessment/scanners/runner.py` (`run_trivy`, `run_semgrep`) vs `backend/opensec/assessment/_fs.py` (`SKIP_DIRS`)
- **What:** `_fs.py` defines a `SKIP_DIRS` set (`fixtures`, `testdata`, `test-fixtures`, `test_fixtures`, plus the usual `node_modules`, `.venv`, etc.) — and the file's own docstring explains *exactly* this scenario: "Without this exclusion we report hundreds of false-positive CVEs on any repo whose parser tests ship an intentionally-vulnerable lockfile (including OpenSec itself)." But that constant is only consumed by `iter_repo_files` in `posture/secrets.py`. Trivy and Semgrep are invoked as subprocesses (`trivy fs <target>`, `semgrep <target>`) with **no `--skip-dirs` / `--exclude` flag**, so they walk the entire target tree and dutifully report CVEs from `backend/tests/fixtures/lockfiles/{npm,pip,go}/...` — exactly the case the comment warned about.
- **Symptom seen this session:** scanning `https://github.com/galanko/OpenSec` produced 47 findings (6 critical / 22 high / 19 medium). On inspection, ~all came from intentionally-broken test fixtures (`backend/tests/fixtures/osv/braces_3_0_2.json`, `backend/tests/fixtures/lockfiles/pip/{requirements.txt, Pipfile.lock, uv/uv.lock}`, etc.). The repo's actual production deps already pin safe versions (frontend `package-lock.json` has `braces 3.0.3`; backend `pyproject.toml` declares no Django and `urllib3>=2.5.0`). The braces "fix" we almost approved would have edited a test fixture and broken the parser test suite.
- **Why it matters:** users running `/secure-repo` against any OpenSec install get a wall of fake "critical" vulnerabilities. Worse, the executor *can* open a draft PR fixing them — which would corrupt scanner test data on real repos. This is the posture issue the user explicitly asked us to find.
- **Suggested fix:** plumb `SKIP_DIRS` through to the scanners. Trivy: `--skip-dirs <csv>`. Semgrep: one `--exclude <dir>` per entry.
- **Status:** fixed in `fix/secure-repo-cli-bugs`. Two iterations:
  1. First pass passed bare-name patterns (`fixtures`, `testdata`, …). Re-scan still produced **47 findings** because Trivy's `--skip-dirs` matches via doublestar globs against paths relative to the scan target — a bare basename only matches at the root, not at `backend/tests/fixtures`.
  2. Switched to `**/<name>` glob form. Re-scan produced **0 findings**, exit 5 ("clean repo"). All 47 original findings were false positives from `backend/tests/fixtures/`. Tests assert the glob form. Semgrep's `--exclude` matches by path segment, so its bare-name form stays.
  - **Verification:** `opensec scan https://github.com/galanko/OpenSec` → `finding_count: 0`, exit `5`.

### 9. `/api/findings?scope=current` excludes posture findings — invisible from /issues and CLI
- **Severity:** **bug** — direct user complaint after the posture fix in #8 surfaced 5 failing checks the user couldn't see or fix.
- **Where:** `backend/opensec/api/routes/findings.py:109-126`
- **What:** The route's docstring states the design: "Posture rows (`type='posture'`) live on the dashboard's posture card and are excluded here." The endpoint hard-codes `type_filter = ["dependency", "code", "secret"]` whenever `scope=current`. Result: the Issues page (UI) and `opensec issues` (CLI) both silently drop every posture finding. After the test-fixture posture fix, the OpenSec repo had 5 failing posture checks (`actions_pinned_to_sha`, `secret_scanning_enabled`, `workflow_trigger_scope`, `trusted_action_sources`, `signed_commits`) — all of them invisible from anywhere a user would normally look.
- **Why it matters:** posture findings are the *whole reason* the assessment grades the repo at C. Hiding them from the actionable surface means users can't drive them to fix. The skill that powers `/secure-repo` therefore can't help with grade A.
- **Suggested fix:** stop filtering by type in `scope=current`. Posture rows have `type=posture` so any consumer that wants only CVE-shaped rows can filter explicitly.
- **Status:** fixed in `fix/secure-repo-cli-bugs` — `list_findings_endpoint` no longer applies a type filter under `scope=current`. New test `test_list_findings_scope_current_includes_posture` locks in the behavior.

### 10. Grade A is gated on GitHub repo settings the daemon can't change
- **Severity:** posture / UX
- **Where:** `backend/opensec/assessment/posture/{branch.py, ci_supply_chain.py, collaborator_hygiene.py}` checks vs `backend/opensec/assessment/engine.py` (`derive_grade`)
- **What:** Six of the ten grade-counting criteria can be fixed with code changes; four require GitHub UI / org-level actions:
  - `branch_protection_enabled` — needs a branch-protection rule on `main` (Settings → Branches)
  - `secret_scanning_enabled` — needs Settings → Code security → Secret scanning enabled
  - `no_stale_collaborators` — needs collaborator audit (Settings → Collaborators)
  - `actions_pinned_to_sha` — workflow file edits (the only one we can drive from a PR)
- Some of these checks return `unknown` without a GitHub PAT configured for the daemon (`GITHUB_TOKEN` env). When `unknown`, the criterion is considered unmet, so even a properly-configured repo grades C until the PAT is wired in.
- **Why it matters:** users running `/secure-repo` will hit a grade ceiling that the skill can't break through. The skill should call this out so they don't think it's broken.
- **Status:** fixed in `fix/secure-repo-cli-bugs` partially:
  1. **`actions_pinned_to_sha`**: pinned every `uses:` in `.github/workflows/{backend,cli,frontend}.yml` to a 40-char SHA with the version comment; release.yml was already pinned. Once the user re-scans this branch, that criterion flips to pass.
  2. **`secret_scanning_enabled`, `branch_protection_enabled`, `no_stale_collaborators`**: skill now lists these explicitly in step 8 (re-assess) with the GitHub-side action each one needs. Skill also tells users to wire `GITHUB_TOKEN` into the daemon env so the checks stop returning `unknown`.

### 11. Skill didn't re-run the assessment after fixes — grade never updated
- **Severity:** posture / skill UX
- **Where:** `plugins/secure-repo/skills/secure-repo/SKILL.md`
- **What:** The skill walked scan → fix → approve → merge → close, then stopped. There was no step to re-run `opensec scan` and report the new grade, so users had no signal that a fix actually moved the needle.
- **Status:** fixed in `fix/secure-repo-cli-bugs` — added a "Re-assess" step (step 8) that runs `opensec scan` after the fix loop and reads `/api/assessment/latest` to report the new grade plus any still-failing criteria. Skill version bumped to 0.1.1.

### 7. `/api/settings/providers` returns ~3 MB of JSON
- **Severity:** improvement
- **Where:** `GET /api/settings/providers`
- **What:** The full providers catalog dumps every model from every provider — 3 MB. Useful for the web UI's model picker, but agents asking "is gpt-5-nano available?" don't need pricing, capabilities, headers, etc.
- **Why it matters:** Token budget for any agent driving OpenSec. Also slow to render.
- **Suggested fix:** Add `?provider=openai&fields=models` query, or a thin `GET /api/settings/providers/{id}/models` returning just IDs + names.
- **Status:** deferred. The new `opensec model list` projects the existing endpoint locally inside the CLI process, so the agent context only sees `[{id, name}]`. Web UI keeps using the full catalog. Re-evaluate when another non-CLI client needs the slim form.
