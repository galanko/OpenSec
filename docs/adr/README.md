# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for OpenSec.

ADRs document significant architectural decisions made during the project. Once accepted, they are immutable records of why a decision was made at a point in time. If a decision is reversed, a new ADR supersedes the old one.
