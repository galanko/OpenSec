"""Output envelope and exit codes for the agent CLI.

Every command returns a single JSON object on stdout and exits with a
state-meaningful code. Errors go to stderr as the same envelope shape with
``ok: false``.

Exit codes are part of the contract — agents branch on them:

  0  — command succeeded; no human gate needed
  1  — generic / unexpected error
  2  — awaiting a human gate (plan approval, validation failure, ...)
  3  — daemon unreachable (install / start OpenSec)
  4  — version mismatch (CLI is too old or too new for this server)
  5  — scan completed with zero findings (clean repo)
