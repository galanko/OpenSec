## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2-alpha] - 2026-04-30

Adds an agent-shaped surface so Claude Code (and other coding agents)
can drive the full remediation loop without ever opening the web UI.
No app behavior or API changes for existing UI users.

### Added

- **Agent CLI (`opensec`)** — six commands (`status`, `scan`, `issues`,
  `fix`, `approve`, `close`) plus `selftest`. JSON-by-default output;
  exit codes encode workflow state (`0` ok · `2` awaiting human · `3`
  daemon down · `4` version mismatch · `5` clean repo). Published as a
  Python sdist release asset (`opensec-cli.tar.gz`); `scripts/install.sh`
  pip-installs it into `~/.opensec/cli-venv` and symlinks the entry
  point to `~/.local/bin/opensec`.
- **`/secure-repo` Claude Code plugin** — published via Anthropic's
  documented plugin marketplace mechanism (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
  + `plugins/secure-repo/`). Users install explicitly with
  `/plugin marketplace add galanko/OpenSec` and
  `/plugin install secure-repo@opensec`. The plugin's skill drives the
  full loop: scan, plan, user-approves, executor, validator, PR, merge
  via `gh`, close. Hard rules: never auto-approve a plan, never
  auto-merge a PR.
- **`GET /api/version`** — version-handshake endpoint returning
  `{opensec, opencode, schema_version, min_cli}`. The CLI calls it once
  per command and refuses to operate when its baked-in version is
  older than `min_cli`.
- **CLI CI** (`.github/workflows/cli.yml`) — lint, tests, sdist build
  on every PR touching `cli/**`.
- **[ADR-0034](docs/adr/0034-agent-cli-and-skill.md)** — design
  rationale for the agent CLI + plugin, including the trust-from-
  first-second decision to avoid silent `~/.claude/` mutation.
- **README** — new "Using Claude Code? Vibe-Security your repo."
  section walks the explicit two-step install (daemon installer +
  `/plugin` commands).

### Changed

- `scripts/install.sh` now installs only the `opensec` CLI to
  `~/.local/bin`; it never touches `~/.claude/`. The end-of-install
  banner prints the two `/plugin` commands the user runs themselves.
- `docs/adr/README.md` — index filled in for ADRs 0025–0034 (had been
  frozen at 0024).

## [0.1.1-alpha] - 2026-04-29

Polishes the install path before handing the alpha to external testers.
No app behavior or API changes.

### Added

- **One-line installer** (`scripts/install.sh`) — `curl -fsSL ...install.sh | sh`
  bootstraps `~/opensec/`, generates `OPENSEC_CREDENTIAL_KEY`, prompts
  for an LLM API key, and runs `docker compose up -d` against the
  release image. Re-run any time to upgrade.
- **Docker boot smoke test** (`backend/tests/docker/test_docker_install.py`)
  using testcontainers — pulls the just-built image, boots it with stub
  credentials, and asserts `/health` reaches 200 within 90s. Wired into
  the release pipeline so a "builds-but-doesn't-start" regression
  blocks publish.
- **Platform-specific install notes** in [docs/install.md](docs/install.md)
  for Linux (SELinux, rootless), macOS Docker Desktop, and Windows WSL2.
- README troubleshooting table covering port conflicts, image pull
  failures, restart loops, and host bind-mount permissions.

### Changed

- `docker/docker-compose.yml` now resolves the image tag via
  `${OPENSEC_VERSION:-latest}` instead of hardcoding `0.1.0-alpha`.
  Existing users: set `OPENSEC_VERSION=0.1.0-alpha` in `.env` to pin.
- `docs/guides/docker-build.md` rewritten — was a "Phase 9 placeholder"
  stub, now documents the local-build path for contributors and points
  end users at [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).
- The release pipeline now uploads `install.sh`, `docker-compose.yml`,
  and `.env.example` as release assets, so
  `/releases/latest/download/install.sh` resolves the curl one-liner.

## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2026-04-28

First public alpha release of OpenSec — a self-hosted, single-container,
chat-led cybersecurity remediation copilot. The image is published to
`ghcr.io/galanko/opensec` and is signed via Sigstore keyless OIDC with
SLSA build provenance and a CycloneDX SBOM attestation.

### Added

- **Findings queue** — import (CSV/JSON/Markdown), filter, sort, triage.
- **Chat-led workspace** — persistent chat per finding with structured
  sidebar state (summary, evidence, owner, plan, ticket, validation).
- **Five sub-agents** — Finding Enricher, Owner Resolver, Exposure
  Analyzer, Remediation Planner, Validation Checker. Each agent's output
  persists into both the chat timeline and the SidebarState.
- **Isolated per-workspace runtime** — every workspace gets its own
  directory, finding-specific context, and dedicated OpenCode process
  on a port from the 4100–4199 pool (ADR-0014).
- **History** — searchable, replayable record of every remediation
  session.
- **Single-container Docker image** — multi-stage build with frontend,
  backend, OpenCode, Trivy, Semgrep, and `gh` CLI bundled. Runs on
  `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.
- **Mock-first adapters** — every integration ships with a working
  fixture; real integrations slot into the same interface.
- **Serene Sentinel design system** — calm, editorial, light-mode-first.
- **Security assessment v2** — dashboard payload (ADR-0032) with
  unified findings model from Trivy + Semgrep subprocess execution
  (ADR-0028).

### Security

- **Image runs as non-root user** `opensec` (UID 10001) by default.
- **Image signing** — every published image is signed via Sigstore
  keyless OIDC. Verify with `cosign verify` (see
  [docs/verify-release.md](docs/verify-release.md)).
- **SLSA build provenance** — attached as an attestation. Verify with
  `gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/galanko/opensec:0.1.0-alpha
  --owner galanko`.
- **CycloneDX SBOM** — attached both as a Sigstore attestation and as
  a release asset for download.
- **Trivy CVE gate at release** — CRITICAL severities block the
  release; HIGH+CRITICAL are uploaded as SARIF to the GitHub Security
  tab.
- **GitHub Environment gate** — every publish requires reviewer
  approval before any push to `ghcr.io`.
- **All third-party GitHub Actions are SHA-pinned** — Dependabot keeps
  them current.
- **Tag protection** on `v*` prevents accidental tag creation.

### Known limitations (alpha)

- Adapters: only CSV / JSON / Markdown imports and the demo fixture
  are wired today. Real adapters (Snyk, GitHub Advanced Security,
  Tenable, Wiz, ServiceNow) are post-MVP — see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
- Single-user only. No multi-tenant authentication.
- Existing `opensec_data` volumes from pre-alpha dev builds are
  root-owned and will not be writable by the new non-root container.
  One-line migration:
  `docker run --rm --user 0 -v opensec_data:/data alpine chown -R 10001:10001 /data`.
