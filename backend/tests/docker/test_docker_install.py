"""Boot the OpenSec Docker image and verify it serves /health.

This is the install-path smoke test. It exists so the release pipeline
catches "the image builds, but doesn't start" regressions before the
artifact is handed to humans.

Scope deliberately small:
  - Boot the container with stub credentials.
  - Wait for /health to return 200.
  - Assert the JSON shape and `opensec == "ok"`.

We do NOT assert `opencode == "ok"` because that requires the model
provider to authenticate against the stub key, which would re-introduce
the very flake we're trying to avoid.
