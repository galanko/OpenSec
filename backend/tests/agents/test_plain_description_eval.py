"""Evaluation harness for the plain_description field (IMPL-0002 C1).

Runs a set of known CVE / misconfiguration fixtures through the real LLM
normalizer and asserts shape-level properties on the resulting
``plain_description`` (2-4 sentences, no jargon, ends with a fix hint).

Each fixture record declares:
  - ``source``: scanner source to feed ``normalize_findings``
  - ``raw_finding``: the raw scanner dict
  - ``must_contain_any``: at least one of these substrings must appear
  - ``must_not_contain_regex``: none of these regexes may match (jargon)
  - ``fix_hint_keywords``: at least one must appear (the fix hint)
  - ``sentence_count_range``: [min, max] sentences allowed

Budget: ~10 LLM calls, roughly $0.02. Skipped automatically when no API
key or OpenCode binary is present (see ``conftest.py``).
