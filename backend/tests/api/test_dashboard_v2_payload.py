"""Architect-mandated regression tests for the v0.2 dashboard payload.

Each test name is called out by name in the IMPL plan as a guard against the
specific drift points the architect flagged. These are the hard contract:

* No legacy ``scanner_versions`` / ``tool_states`` fields anywhere.
* Posture rows on the wire use four-state vocabulary
  (``pass | fail | done | advisory``); never a bare ``passed: bool``.
* The ``done`` state is a read-time projection from a posture check's
  ``pr_url`` field — no persisted column toggles state.
* Criteria responses are labeled lists, not anonymous booleans.
* Vulnerability counts split by source (``dependency | code | secret``).
* The ``summary_seen_at`` flag is server-side, idempotent, and sourced from
  the assessment row — never from a URL param or localStorage.
* Assessment-status responses carry ``steps[]`` + ``tools[]`` and the
  ``posture`` step in ``pending`` advertises the ``hint = '15 checks'``.
