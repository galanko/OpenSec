"""OpenAPI schema snapshot test (EXEC-0002 Session 0).

This test freezes the contract surface that every downstream EXEC-0002 session
builds against. If the schema diverges from the committed snapshot, either:

  1) the divergence is intentional — re-run with ``UPDATE_SNAPSHOT=1`` to
     rewrite the snapshot and commit both changes together, or
  2) it's an accidental break — fix the route to match the snapshot.

Keeping the snapshot JSON under version control forces every contract change
to show up in a PR diff.
