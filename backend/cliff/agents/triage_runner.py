"""Triage run path (ADR-0051 / IMPL-0024 V1-4).

Reuses the workspace agent-execution machinery rather than standing up a second
pipeline. For a **scanner** finding a triage run is enricher → exposure →
deterministic synthesis; for a **report** finding it is a single
``report_triager`` run (which carries its own dual-persist). Either way the
verdict lands in both the chat timeline and ``sidebar.triage`` (the CLAUDE.md
agent-output rule).

Triage never advances ``Finding.status``: a finding stays ``new`` through
triage and only becomes ``triaged`` on human confirmation of a ``real`` verdict
(the Plan gate — ADR-0051 §6).
