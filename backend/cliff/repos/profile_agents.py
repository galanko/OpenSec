"""The Project-profile builders (ADR-0053 §3, Phase 1.6).

Three are in-process Pydantic AI agents (ADR-0047) that read the cached clone
(read-only) and emit one typed artifact. The fourth, ``dep_manifest``, is a
**deterministic** lockfile-graph parser (no LLM). All satisfy the
``ProfileBuilder`` shape (``async (clone_dir) -> dict``) so :class:`ProfileRunner`
can drive them uniformly.

Deps reuse: profile builders run on a *clone*, not a finding workspace, but the
``read`` tool is keyed on ``WorkspaceDeps.workspace_dir`` — so we reuse
``WorkspaceDeps`` with ``workspace_dir`` pointing at the clone and an empty
``finding``. That reuses the entire tool + runtime path with zero duplication
("delete before adding"); the repo metadata is threaded through the task prompt.

Read-only by design (the whole profiling tier touches nothing): the only tool is
``read``. ``PROFILE_BUILDER_TOOLS`` makes that boundary one assertable thing.
