"""RepoKnowledge — the declared-consumption access layer (ADR-0053 §5).

Agents never open profile files directly. Each Tier-2 agent (ADR-0052)
*declares* which profile sections it consumes; the runtime loads **only** those
into a ``RepoKnowledge`` view and renders them into the prompt — so no agent
pays tokens for a section it doesn't use (the mechanism that makes eager
profiling affordable). Reading actual source is a separate concern: the
read/grep tools over :attr:`RepoKnowledge.clone_dir`.

This mirrors how ``WorkspaceDeps`` already feeds per-finding context to agents,
for the per-repo tier.
