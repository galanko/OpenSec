"""Version handshake for the agent CLI.

The agent-facing `opensec` CLI calls `GET /api/version` on every command (with
a 60s cache) so it can:

  1. show the running daemon version to the user, and
  2. refuse to operate if its own build is older than `min_cli` —
     i.e. the contract has moved and the user needs to upgrade their CLI.

The plain `/health` endpoint stays for liveness probes; this one is the
contract surface for tooling.
